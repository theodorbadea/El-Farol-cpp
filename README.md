# El-Farol-cpp

This repository contains a C++ implementation of the El Farol Bar problem, originally proposed by Brian Arthur, with a two-bars variation. The El Farol Bar problem is a classic problem in game theory and complex systems, used to illustrate the dynamics of collective decision-making and the concept of coordination failure.

Overview
The El Farol Bar problem simulates a scenario where patrons of a bar (El Farol) must decide whether to attend based on their prediction of how crowded the bar will be. If too few or too many people attend, it leads to dissatisfaction. The challenge is to predict attendance accurately to maximize individual utility.

In this implementation, we extend the classic El Farol problem by introducing a second bar, offering patrons an additional venue choice. Each patron must decide which bar to attend based on their estimation of the crowd size at both bars.

Features
C++ Implementation: The simulation is written in C++, providing efficient and scalable performance.
Two-Bars Variation: Introduces a second bar to the El Farol problem, offering patrons an alternative venue choice.
Agent-Based Modeling: Uses agent-based modeling techniques to simulate the decision-making process of individual patrons.
Strategy Evaluation: Evaluates various strategies for attendance prediction and bar selection, allowing for the comparison of different decision-making approaches.
Visualization: Provides visualization tools to analyze the simulation results, including crowd size dynamics and the effectiveness of different strategies.
